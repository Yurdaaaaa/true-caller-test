# 📱 Android App

An Android application built using the MVI architecture, leveraging a single-activity approach and Conductor for managing screen navigation and lifecycle. This project demonstrates clean code practices, unidirectional data flow, and reactive UI handling.


## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Single-Activity Architecture** – all navigation and UI is managed within a single activity
- **MVI Architecture** – unidirectional data flow ensures predictable and testable state management
- **[Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor)** – a lightweight navigation and lifecycle framework for managing view controllers
- **[RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)** –  reactive programming built on top of RxJava
- **[RxRelay](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxRelay)** – event and state handling without completion
- **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)** – HTTP client for interacting with REST APIs
- **[Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)** –  Dependency injection
- **[JUnit](https://github.com/junit-team)** – Unit Testing

## 🧠 Threading & Use Case Execution

HTML processing use cases run on a **computation thread**, since they involve CPU-bound operations like parsing, character extraction or mapping.  
In contrast, HTML downloading is an **I/O-bound operation** and therefore runs on the **IO thread**, similarly to other asynchronous operations such as:

- database access
- reading/writing to `SharedPreferences`
- file system operations

Threading is explicitly controlled using a shared `SchedulerModule`, allowing clean separation of concerns and predictable performance.

## 🧩 Core Dependency Injection Modules

The `core` module defines three key Dagger modules located in the package `com.zj.hometest.core.di`:

1. [`HtmlUseCaseModule`](core/src/main/java/com/zj/hometest/core/di/HtmlUseCaseModule.kt)  
   Provides all use cases responsible for HTML content processing (parsing, word counting, etc.)

2. [`NetModule`](core/src/main/java/com/zj/hometest/core/di/NetModule.kt)  
   Configures the networking layer, including the HTTP client, API interfaces, and interceptors.

3. [`SchedulerModule`](core/src/main/java/com/zj/hometest/core/di/SchedulerModule.kt)  
   Defines `IO` and `Computation` schedulers injected into use cases and networking manager to ensure correct threading.

These modules promote testability, clarity, and modularity across the application.

## Testing

Unit testing is implemented using JUnit and TestScheduler from io.reactivex.schedulers. The core business logic is thoroughly tested through the following unit test classes:

- [`/core/Html15thCharacterUseCaseTest`](core/src/test/java/com/zj/hometest/core/Html15thCharacterUseCaseTest.kt)
- [`/core/HtmlEvery15thCharacterUseCaseTest`](core/src/test/java/com/zj/hometest/core/HtmlEvery15thCharacterUseCaseTest.kt)
- [`/core/HtmlWordCounterUseCaseTest`](core/src/test/java/com/zj/hometest/core/HtmlWordCounterUseCaseTest.kt)
